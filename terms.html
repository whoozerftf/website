        advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do
        not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential
        or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability
        shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

        of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and
        enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
